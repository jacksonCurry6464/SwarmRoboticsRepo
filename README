This repository contains the final version of work that was used to run swarm robotics simulations.  The pythonFiles folder contains the final versions of python code used to control the robots.  The arduinoIRRead folder contains Arduino code used to control some sensors.  Trial Data folder contains data taken during experiments.  Finally there is a pdf of an early version of the paper that was later published in IEEE magazine.
